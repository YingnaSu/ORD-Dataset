The ORD dataset including 1643 color images are part of the Oxford Robotcar dataset. 
The images are randomly selected from 10 sequences of Oxford Robotcar dataset and are stored to 10 folders with the same names of the sequence files, respectively. At the same time, all the images are integrated into a single folder for the ease of use.
For evaluation, all the images are manually labeled to generate the ground truth data, including the location of the vanishing point and the road region.
